# Klein-Neumann-ConverIt
Group Project - Spring 2017 

This website allows the user to convert between different units of measurement. It includes temperature, weight, length and time. We  also included currency conversions which pull the data from the ExchangeRate API (https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). We did it using an API because the currency exchange rates are constantly changing.
One of the options on the menu is contact us. When selected from any webpage, there is a modal that pops up with a contact form. This sends an email to both the user and the website email, using PHP mail.
